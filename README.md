# Binary-Tree-Subtree-Analysis
This repository contains a Python implementation for constructing a binary tree from a given input, analyzing the maximum subtree sum, and finding the path to the node with the maximum subtree sum. The implementation uses a divide-and-conquer approach to solve the problem efficiently.
